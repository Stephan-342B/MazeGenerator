# Run
Clone the project.  
Run Maze.java under **org.mahefa.matrix.maze.controller**.

# Build your own
Generate a matrix of size n x m.  
Apply *Aldous-Border*'s algorithm to generate a maze.  
use A* algorithm or another path finding.  
For A*, we can optimized it by implementing min-heap or priority queue to store visited neighbors and by the way, get a time 
complexity of *O(1)* while retrieving the lowest f score value.
